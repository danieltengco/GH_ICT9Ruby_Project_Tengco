		<p>FightFire NCR is a volunteer non-government organization that aims to educate citizens about ways to prevent and handle fire incidents before emergency response groups arrive.</p>
		<p>March kicks off the summer feels in the Philippines and while many are preparing for the most awaited summer getaways, men and women in orange overalls are gearing to respond to another kind of heat, the fire. The month of March also signals alert to fire incidents due to increased temperature in the archipelago. This highlights the importance of implementing fire safety practices in your home and in the workplace.</p>
		<p>Prevention is the best way to fight a fire. A fire prevention program aims to achieve these three goals:
			<ul>
				<li>Prevent the loss of life</li>
				<li>Protect properties from damage</li>
				<li>Avoid downtimes caused by operational disruptions</li>
			</ul>
			Following these fire prevention tips can help make your environment safe from fire risks.

				<th colspan="2"><center>Simple Fire Safety Tips</center></th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Avoid Electrical Overloading</b></h6><br>As much as possible, avoid piggybacking multiple devices on one plugging strip to prevent sockets from overheating and catching fire. Big appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners should also have their dedicated outlets to make sure that electrical overloading won’t be a problem. Also, practice unplugging your devices and appliances when not in use.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Check Electrical Connections for Faulty Wiring</b></h6><br>Faulty electrical wiring can cause a fire when flammable and combustible materials are introduced into the picture. To prevent a fire incident, have a licensed electrician periodically check your appliances for exposed or worn wires. When you spot frayed wires, damaged sockets, or defective electrical equipment, have them fixed or replaced immediately.</td>
				<td><img src="https://25174313.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/25174313/assets_moneymax/faulty-wiring.png" width="300px" class="rounded"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Ensure Safety in the Kitchen</b></h6><br>Whatever you do in the kitchen, don’t leave an open stove unattended. If you have to exit the room, make sure someone else can watch the fire for you. But if there’s no one to delegate that task to, just turn off the stove altogether until you can attend to it again. You can also opt to bring an alarm or timer with you to serve as a reminder that there’s something cooking in the other room.</td>
				<td><img src="https://25174313.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/25174313/assets_moneymax/kitchen-safety.png" width="300px" class="rounded"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Turn Off Gas Tanks When Not in Use</b></h6><br>Always close your liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) after use. Also, constantly check it for leaks or damages to avoid not only fire but also health risks.</td>
				<td><img src="https://25174313.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/25174313/assets_moneymax/turn-off-gas-tanks.png" width="300px" class="rounded"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Keep Your Light Sources Secured</b></h6><br>Make sure that you use sturdy candle holders that can keep your candles in place. Also, look for a clear spot where the candles can’t be accidentally tipped over. It’s also logical to keep your candles away from things that can catch fire, including curtains, carpets, bedsheets, and paper. Better yet, use a rechargable lamp or flashlight during a power outage</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Remove Potential Fire Hazards</b></h6><br>Sometimes, what sets off a fire is random: a stack of old newspapers, a mound of empty plastic bottles, a clump of overgrown shrubs. A pile of leaves in your front yard looks harmless enough until extreme heat turns it into an unintentional bonfire.</td>
				<td><img src="https://25174313.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/25174313/assets_moneymax/remove-potential-fire-hazards.png" width="300px" class="rounded"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Practice Good Housekeeping Habits</b></h6><br>Keep aisles, walkways, and stairways clear of any trash and loose objects. Having clean and clear pathways at home or in the office can prevent the spread of fire. It also gives people enough space to move and evacuate when the need arises.</td>
				<td><img src="https://25174313.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/25174313/assets_moneymax/good-housekeeping.png" width="300px" class="rounded"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Observe Proper Smoking Etiquette</b></h6><br>Don't smoke inside the house, unless you have a designated smoking area designed to prevent fires. Smoking in bed, especially, should be avoided at all costs. Fabrics and paddings can catch fire easily, so you want to stay as far away from them as possible when smoking.</td>
				<td><img src="https://25174313.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hub/25174313/hubfs/assets_moneymax/smoking-1.png?width=1200&height=800&name=smoking-1.png" width="300px" class="rounded"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Install Smoke Alarms</b></h6><br>It’s good to have smoke alarms in place to alert you when a fire breaks out. When a smoke alarm rings, it’s not yet too late. There’s still a lot you can do. However, depending on the gravity of the situation, smoke alarms sometimes do nothing but announce impending doom.</td>
				<td><img src="https://25174313.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hub/25174313/hubfs/assets_moneymax/smoke-alarm.png?width=1200&height=800&name=smoke-alarm.png" width="300px" class="rounded"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h6 class="text-warning"><b>Keep a Fire Extinguisher Within Reach</b></h6><br>Having a fire extinguisher at home or in the office doesn't directly prevent a fire, but it can surely help stop it from spreading. Using just water to contain a fire isn’t always advisable, as fires caused by electrical problems will just inflict greater damage when put out using a liquid. Inspect your fire extinguisher at least once a year to make sure it’s still working. There shouldn’t be any cracks, the locking pin should be in place, and the handle should still be safely lodged in its position. If you find any defect, confirm with an expert if your fire extinguisher is still good or if you already need a new one.</td>
				<td><img src="https://25174313.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hub/25174313/hubfs/assets_moneymax/fire-extinguisher.png?width=1200&height=800&name=fire-extinguisher.png" width="300px" class="rounded"></td>
